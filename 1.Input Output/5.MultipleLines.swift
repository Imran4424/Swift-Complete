/*
        In, swift putting semicolon (;)  after every statement is not mandatory

        you can put semicolon (;) after every statement but it works really fine without it

        but it is not recomended to put semicolon (;) after every statement

        but

        when we write multiple statements in single line, then it become mandatory to put semicolon (;) between two statements to
        separate them from each other
